      <h2 dir="lrt">Course Description</h2>
      <p><strong>Internet and advances in technology have allowed us to collect massive amounts of diverse types of data. There is an increasing recognition that data created by social media, sensors, healthcare, smart grid and the like could be translated into valuable insights. Companies adopting “data-driven decision-making” are achieving significant productivity gains over other firms. Countless startups are popping up with original ideas how to creatively use the data. Governments and cities are turning their data public in hopes that it could lead to improvements in quality of life of their citizens. A data scientist is a person who has the skills, knowledge, and ability to extract actionable knowledge from the data -- either for the good of society, advancement of science, or profit in business. This class is an introduction to the practice of data science. The student will leave the class with a broad set of practical data analytic skills based on building real analytic applications on real data. These skills include collecting, accessing, and transferring data, applying methods from machine learning and data mining to analyze data, and visualization and presentation of results. The students will gain experience in processing “big data” which are too big to fit in the computer’s memory. </strong>
